# Project Statement

- Create a Jupyter notebook
- Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of my choosing 
- Model and synthesise such data using Python (suggest to use the numpy.random package for this purpose)
- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

# Notes

This README only contains an explanation on how to run the Jupyter notebook. The Jupyter notebook contains the main body of work and list all references used the in the project.

A Version Control folder is added.
A Data folder added
Real-world data selected  - The Framingham Heart Study

A python code is included in the Version Control folder called [Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2021.py](https://github.com/DPR-droid/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2021/blob/main/Version%20Control/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2021-V1.py)

# Review the Assignment

How to run or review the Jupyter notebook.      

## Github
Review the assignment [Click here Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2021.ipynb](https://github.com/DPR-droid/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2021/blob/main/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2021-V1.ipynb)

## NBViewer
NBViewer is another way to share Jupyter Notebook.

## Binder
Try this assignment without installing by clicking the Binder badge below, this allows you to run the Jupyter notebook in an online virtual executable environment, making the code immediately reproducible by anyone, anywhere. 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DPR-droid/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2021/main?filepath=Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2021-V1.ipynb)

**import warnings** not included in requirements.txt as it was causing an issue when building the online virtual executable environment.

## Try at home

To try this on your own PC you require the following:
- Install Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual this ditribution includes Python and serveral packages used in this Assignment including the numpy package. 
- 'requirments.txt' for other modules required. 
- Install Jupyter https://jupyter.org/ to run Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2021.ipynb
- Install Github
- git clone git@github.com:DPR-droid/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project-2021.git

    "- Create a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "- Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of my choosing \n",
    "- Model and synthesise such data using Python (suggest to use the numpy.random package for this purpose)\n",
    "- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",

    "# The Framingham Heart Study \n",
    "\n",
    "The Framingham Heart Study is now considered one of the longest, most important epidemiological studies in medical history. In the 1960s, the study demonstrated the role cigarette smoking plays in the development of heart disease. Those findings helped to fuel the first anti-smoking campaigns of that era. The study provided researchers with knowledge of how dietary fat can increase the risk of heart disease. It showed a link between cholesterol levels in the blood and an individual's risk for developing heart disease. Later, Framingham data also demonstrated the beneficial role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and the negative consequences of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This program has helped to educate physicians, patients, and the public about the dangers of high blood cholesterol and to bring about reductions in Americans' blood cholesterol levels. [2]"

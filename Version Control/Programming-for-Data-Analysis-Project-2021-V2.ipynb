    "# The Framingham Heart Study \n",

    "The Framingham Heart Study is now considered one of the longest, most important epidemiological studies in medical history. In the 1960s, the study demonstrated the role cigarette smoking plays in the development of heart disease. Those findings helped to fuel the first anti-smoking campaigns of that era. The study provided researchers with knowledge of how dietary fat can increase the risk of heart disease. It showed a link between cholesterol levels in the blood and an individual's risk for developing heart disease. Later, Framingham data also demonstrated the beneficial role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and the negative consequences of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This program has helped to educate physicians, patients, and the public about the dangers of high blood cholesterol and to bring about reductions in Americans' blood cholesterol levels. [2]"
